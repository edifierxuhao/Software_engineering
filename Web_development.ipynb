    "### Front end\n",
    "- The first part is the content, which includes text, images, videos and forms. We can control this content with a language called HTML.\n",
    "- The second part is the design, like the colors, font styles and layout, we manage using another language called CSS.\n",
    "- The third part includes all of the animations and interactivity such as fade-ins, slideshows, and pop-ups. The code to make this happen is written in a language called JavaScript.\n",

    "### Back end\n",
    "The back end is responsible for running the web app. The back end includes the server where the website files are stored. When you tpye in a web address and hit 'Enter', you actually asking the server to send you the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that make up the front end of you web app.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Explanation of the HTML document\n",
    "As you progress through the lesson, you'll find that the `<head>` tag is mostly for housekeeping like specifying the page title and adding meta tags. Meta tags are in essence information about the page that web crawlers see but users do not. The head tag also contains links to javascript and css files, which you'll see later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website content goes in the `<body>` tag. The body tag can contain headers, paragraphs, images, links, forms, lists, and a handful of other tags. Of particular note in this example are the link tag `<a>` and the image tag `<img>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these tags link to external information outside of the html doc. In the html code above, the link `<a>` tag links to an external website called w3schools. The href is called an attribute, and in this case href specifies the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image `<img>` tag displays an image called \"photo.jpg\". In this case, the jpg file and the html document are in the same directory, but the documents do not have to be. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file relative to the html document. The alt tag contains text that gets displaced in case the image cannot be found.\n",

    "## What is the Purpose of CSS?\n",
    "In most professional websites, css is kept in a separate stylesheet. This makes it easier to separate content (html) from style (css). Code becomes easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in the history of css and how it came about, here is an interesting link: [history of css](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS stands for **cascading style sheets**. The \"cascading\" refers to how rules trickle down to the various layers of an html tree. For example, you might specify that all paragraphs have the same font type. But then you want to override one of the paragraphs to have a different font type. How does a browser decide which rules apply when there is a conflict? That's based on the cascade over. You can read more about that [here](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-cascade-mean-3466872).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different ways to write CSS\n",
    "As discussed in the video, there are essentially two ways to write CSS: inline or with a stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inline means that you specify the CSS directly inside of an html tag like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively, you can put the CSS in a stylesheet. The stylesheet can go underneath an html head tag like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "...\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "   <style>\n",
    "       p {font-size: 20px;}\n",
    "   </style>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Or the css can go into its own separate css file (extension .css). Then you can link to the css file within the html head tag like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where style.css is the path to the style.css file. Inside the style.css file would be the style rules such as\n",
    "```css\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  color:red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"

    "## CSS Rules and Syntax\n",
    "CSS is essentially a set of rules that you can use to stylize html. The [W3 Schools CSS Website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a good place to find all the different rules you can use. These including styling text, links, margins, padding, image, icons and background colors among other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. select the html element, id, and/or class of interest\n",
    "2. specify what you want to change about the element\n",
    "3. specify a value, followed by a semi-colon\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "a {\n",
    "  text-decoration:none;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where a is the element of interest, text-decoration is what you want to change, and none is the value. You can write multiple rules within one set of brackets like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "a {\n",
    "  text-decoration:none;\n",
    "  color:blue;\n",
    "  font-weight:bold;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also select elements by their class or id.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select by class name, you use a dot like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".class_name {\n",
    "   color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To select by id name, you use the pound sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "#id_name {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make more complex selections as well like \"select paragraphs inside the div with id \"div_top\" . If your html looks like this,\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<div id=\"div_top\">\n",
    "   <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then the CSS would be like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "div#div_top p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Margins and Padding\n",

    "## Specifying Size: Pixels versus Percent versus EM Units\n",
    "In CSS there are various ways to define sizes, widths, and heights. The three main ones are pixels, percentages, and em units.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use px, you're defining the exact number of pixels an element should use in terms of size. So\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means the font-size will be exactly 12 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percent and em units have a similar function. They dynamically change sizing based on a browser's default values. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 100%\"> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means to use the default browser font size. 150% would be 1.5 times the default font size. 50% would be half. Similarly, 1em unit would be 1 x default_font. So 2em would be 2 x default font, etc. The advantage of using percents and em is that your web pages become dynamic. The document adapts to the default settings of whatever device someone is using be that a desktop, laptop or mobile phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, percentages and em units are actually calculating sizes relative to parent elements in the html tree. For example, if you specify a font size in a body tag , then the percentages will be relative to the body element:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<body style=\"font-size: 20px\">\n",
    "    <p style=\"font-size:80%\">This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "...\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different browsers might render html and CSS differently, there isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to specify sizes. This will depend on who will use your website and on what type of devices. You can read more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp). You won't need to worry about all of this because in the web app, you're going to use a CSS framework that takes care of all of this for you."

    "- Java and javaScript are two completely different languages that happen to have similar names.\n",
    "- JavaScript syntax, especially for front-end web development, is a bit tricky. It's much easier to write front-end JavaScript code using a framework such as [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript as a language can be used for both front-end and back-end web development. In terms of front-end development there are many libraries available such as jQuery, Angular and React. For back-end development, you can use node.js.\n",

    "Here are a few rules to keep in mind when writing JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a line of code ends with a semi-colon ;\n",
    "- () parenthesis are used when calling a function much like in Python\n",
    "- {} curly braces surround large chunks of code or are used when initializing dictionaries\n",

    "## jQuery Syntax\n",
    "The jQuery library simplifies JavaScript quite a bit. Compare the syntax. Compare these two examples from the video for changing the h1 title element when clicking on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pure JavaScript code for changing the words in the h1 title element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function headFunction() {\n",
    "   document.getElementsByTagName(\"h1\")[0].innerHTML = \n",
    "        \"A Photo of a Breathtaking View\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code searches the html document for all h1 tags, grabs the first h1 tag in the array of h1 tags, and then changes the html. Note that the above code is only the function. You'd also have to add an onClick action in the image html tag like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<img src=\"image.jpg\" onclick=\"headFunction()\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The jQuery code is more intuitive. Once the document has loaded, the following code adds an onclick event to the image. Once the image is clicked, the h1 tag's text is changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "$(document).ready(function(){\n",
    "    $(\"img\").click(function(){\n",
    "        $(\"h1\").text(\"A Photo of a Breathtaking View\");\n",
    "    });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "       \n",
    "The dollar sign $ is jQuery syntax that says \"grab this element, class or id\". That part of the syntax should remind you somewhat of CSS. For example `$(\"p#first\")` means find the paragraph with id=\"first\". Or `$(\"#first\")` would work as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript has something called callback function, which can make learning javascript a bit tricky. Callback functions are essentially functions that can be inputs into other functions. In the above code, there is the ready() function that waits for the html document to load. Then there is another function being passed into the ready function. This section function adds an on-click event to an image tag. Then there's another function passed into the click() function, which changes the h1 text."

    "Because the web app you're developing will have a Python back-end, you can use the Python library to create your charts. Rather than having you learn more JavaScript syntax, you can use the Python syntax that you already know. However, you haven't built a back-end yet, so for now, you'll see the basics of how Plotly works using the JavaScript library. The syntax between the Python and Javascript versions is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the lesson, you'll switch to the Python version of the Plotly library so that you can prepare visualizations on the back-end of your web app. Yet you could write all the visualization code in JavaScript if you wanted to. Watch the screencast below to learn the basics of how Plotly works, and then continue on to the Plotly exercise.\n",

    "# The Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next part of the lesson, you'll build a backend using Flask. Because Flask is written in Python, you can use any Python library in your backend including pandas and scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lesson, you'll practice\n",
    "\n",
    "- setting up the backend\n",
    "- linking the backend and the frontend together\n",
    "- deploying the app to a server so that the app is available from a web address\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). A web framework takes care of all the routing needed to organize a web page so that you don't have to write the code yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type \"http://www.udacity.com\" into a browser, your computer sends out a request to another computer (ie the server) where the Udacity website is stored. Then the Udacity server sends you the files needed to render the website in your browser. The Udacity computer is called a server because it \"serves\" you the files that you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP part of the web address stands for Hypter-text Transfer Protocol. HTTP defines a standard way of sending and receiving messages over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hit enter in your browser, your computer says \"get me the files for the web page at www.udacity.com\": except that message is sent to the server with the syntax governed by HTTP. Then the server sends out the files via the protocol as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There needs to be some software on the server that can interpret these HTTP requests and send out the correct files. That's where a web framework like Flask comes into play. A framework abstracts the code for receiving requests as well as interpreting the requests and sending out the correct files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Flask?\n",
    "First and foremost, you'll be working with Flask because it is written in Python. You won't need to learn a new programming language.\n",
    "Flask is also a relatively simple framework, so it's good for making a small web app.\n",
    "Because Flask is written in Python, you can use Flask with any other Python library including pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. In this lesson, you'll be deploying a data dashboard and pandas will help get the data ready.\n",
    "Continue on to start building the backend."
